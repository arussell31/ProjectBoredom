# Smart Alarm

## Intro

* Are you struggling to wake up in the morning? You know you have an important day ahead, but you can't seem to wake up on time.
* Have you tried several methods to wake up but they all stop working?
* Is your bed just too comfortable to leave?
* Smart alarm is just the thing for you!

## What is it?

* Smart alarm is a band that goes around your ankle and tells your alarm clock if you are up and out of bed. If you lay back down within a set timeframe your alarm will start going off again.

## Who is it for?

* Professionals with a tight schedule
* Teenagers
* Parents of teenagers
* YOU!

## How does it work

* The Smart alarm technology is built with an Arduino, an MPU-9150 Inertial Measurement Unit, a bluetooth chip, and an app on a smart phone.
* You, the inventor, will build the app and the smart band using your Arduino kit, your phone and some supplies around your home.
  
* ADD IMAGE OF OVERALL FLOW
